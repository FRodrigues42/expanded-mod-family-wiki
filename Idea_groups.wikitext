:{{Hatnote|For the ideas of American natives, see [[native ideas]].}}

As a nation develops [[technology|technologically]], it unlocks the ability to gain additional ''idea groups''. Investing into a full idea group can take a long time and cost several decades worth of power. The act of choosing at any point of time a certain idea group over the other and advancing in it represent the time and focus nations choose to spend historically along certain administrative, diplomatic, and military specializations. 

== Mechanics summary ==
{{SVersion|1.31}}
Each nation can have up to 8 idea groups from a pool of 19 groups (only 18 are shown as the Aristocratic and Plutocratic idea groups are locked behind exclusive government reforms). Idea group choice is only restricted by the requirement for a balanced mix of groups: No more than half of a nation's chosen idea groups, whether completed or not, can have the same associated type of {{icon|all power costs}} monarch power.<ref>See in {{path|defines}}: MAX_IDEA_GROUPS_FROM_SAME_CATEGORY = 0.5,</ref> This limit can be turned off in [[options]] before starting a game without disabling achievements.

Idea group choices are unrestricted, with several exceptions: [[#Plutocratic|Plutocratic ideas]] are enabled for most [[republics]] but disabled for most other government types; [[#Aristocratic|Aristocratic ideas]] are disabled for most [[republics]] but enabled for most other government types; [[#Divine|Divine ideas]] are enabled only for [[theocracies]]; [[#Horde Government|Horde Government ideas]] are enabled only for  [[steppe nomads]]; [[#Indigenous|Indigenous ideas]] are enabled only for [[native tribe]]s and [[#Maritime|Maritime]] and [[#Naval|Naval ideas]] are disabled for [[primitives]]. However, AI nations have [[Idea_groups#AI_preference|weights]] assigned to the idea groups to make their choices random but still somewhat historical.

Each idea group consists of 7 ideas. Advancing within an idea group is done sequentially and each unlocked idea enhances a particular aspect of the nation. Unlocking the last idea in the group also unlocks the group's bonus.

=== Unlocking new slots ===
New idea group slots are unlocked with the advancement in {{icon|adm tech}} Administrative technology as described below:

{| class="mildtable" style="text-align:left"
! {{icon|adm tech}} Administrative tech level
! 5 !! 7 !! 10 !! 14 !! 18 !! 22 !! 26 !! 29
|-
! {{icon|idea unlock}} Number of idea groups
|| {{green|1}} || {{green|2}} || {{green|3}} || {{green|4}} || {{green|5}} || {{green|6}} || {{green|7}} || {{green|8}}
|-
! {{icon|time}} Year in which the technology loses its ahead of time penalty
|| 1453 || 1479 || 1518 || 1570 || 1622 || 1674 || 1730 || 1775
|}

=== Abandoning idea groups ===
{{expansion|aow}}
Abandoning an idea group can be used to free up an idea slot if it no longer serves the nation and there may be others more suitable groups that do so. It is important to note, however, that doing so will result in losing all the given bonuses from said idea group and will only refund 10% of the {{icon|all power costs}} monarch power points invested in the group<ref>See in {{path|defines}}: ABANDON_IDEAGROUP_REFUND = 0.10, ''-- The part of the idea group spent that will be refunded upon abandonment.''</ref>. Discarding idea groups will also impact the number of Ideas a nation has towards unlocking [[National Ideas]] and Ambitions.

Due to the low refund rate and the importance of monarch power points, picking an idea group should be done with its future usefulness to the nation in mind. However, this option should not be disregarded either as it is extremely useful in the right circumstances. For example: 
* Primitives can take only the first 3-4 Exploration ideas, get a colonial border with a western power, then drop Exploration for something else. Some would benefit more from the Expansion idea group; but Expansion doesn't allow Explorers or long-range island-hopping. They could even opt out of colonization altogether after getting the border they needed.

=== Technology cost reduction ===
Each unlocked idea grants a {{icon|tech cost}} {{green|−2%}} Technology cost reduction. The reduction can result in up to {{green|−14%}} for a fully unlocked idea group (without accounting for further reductions that may be applied from the ideas themselves). The type of the reduction depends on the affiliation of the idea group; for example, the {{icon|Espionage}} Espionage idea group grants {{icon|dip tech cost}} Diplomatic tech cost reduction.

=== Innovativeness gain ===
Being the first nation to unlock an idea or unlocking an idea within 90 days after it is first unlocked gives a nation a base of {{green|+2}}[[file:Innovativeness.png|24px]] [[innovativeness]].

=== Policies ===
{{main|Policies}}
Policies become enabled when a pair of 2 idea groups are fully unlocked. Picking a {{icon|policy}} policy provides a bonus to the nation at the monthly cost of 1 monarch power per policy (type of monarch power used depends on policy affiliation) if the limit is overwhelmed (base: 1 policy of each type can be picked for free) . Once picked, a policy cannot be canceled for a duration of {{icon|time}} 10 years. There is no restriction on policy composition and a nation can activate up to 9 policies at a time, 3 per type.

== Idea cost ==
{{SVersion|1.30}}
Unlocking an idea has a base [[File:Idea cost.png|24px]] idea cost of {{icon|all power costs}} {{red|400}} monarch power<ref>See in {{path|common/defines.lua}}: PS_BUY_IDEA = 400</ref> (the type of power depending on the idea group).

The base [[File:Idea cost.png|24px]] idea cost is modified by the following:

Several missions, decisions and events grant modifiers that affect idea cost.

== National ideas ==
{{SVersion|Timeless}}
{{Main|National ideas}}
Every country has seven national ideas. These ideas do not cost any [[monarch points]] but instead are unlocked; one national idea is unlocked for every third idea bought normally from an idea group.

Many nations have unique national ideas while a large number of others have national ideas based upon a common geographic region or a shared culture. The rest of the nations, who lack unique NIs or don't share a common NI group, draw their national ideas from a common generic set of ideas. 

;National tradition
:Every nation also starts with a national tradition: two abilities which define the history and heritage of the country. 

;National ambition
:Countries also have a “national ambition”, which is a bonus that is unlocked when a nation has gained all seven of its national ideas. This bonus is also unique for each country.

== Events ==
{{Main|List of idea group events}}
Idea group events are pulse based [[events]]. They occur at regular intervals (5 years) based on the nation's idea groups (not all groups are on the same interval).

In addition, the choice of ideas also has some influence in how often an event may happen, known as MTTH; meaning they can increase or decrease the likelihood of a certain to happened in over other events in their pulse group.

== AI preference ==
{{SVersion|1.30}}
The [[AI]] is dynamically determined according to the current conditions of the country.<ref>It is still possible to revert to the old system by changing "AI_USES_HISTORICAL_IDEA_GROUPS" to 1 in {{path|common/defines.lua}}. Note, however, that the AI will never use historical idea groups in a custom/random setup.</ref>
To decide which idea group it should take, the AI employs a "weight system": each idea group is given a certain weight and the higher this weight is for an idea group, the higher the chances that the AI will choose it. The AI will never choose an idea group with a weight of 0.<ref>The weights and their modifiers are defined in {{path|common/ideas/00_basic_ideas.txt}} at the bottom of each idea group (ai_will_do).</ref>
